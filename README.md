# Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow

Welcome to my repository for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course from Coursera's deeplearning.ai TensorFlow Specialization. This repository includes:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Weekly assignments demonstrating various NLP techniques and models.
- **Course Notes**: Images and summaries of key concepts from each week.
- **Data**: Datasets used in the course for sentiment analysis, word embeddings, and sequence modeling.

### Course Overview
In this course, I learned to:
- Tokenize and vectorize text for neural network input.
- Use embeddings to map words into high-dimensional vectors.
- Implement sequence models like RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs for text prediction.
- Create a poetry generator trained on traditional Irish lyrics.

### Folder Structure
- `Week_1`: Sentiment analysis and text tokenization.
- `Week_2`: Word embeddings and sentiment classification.
- `Week_3`: Sequence models and context understanding.
- `Week_4`: Predicting the next word.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and data. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git`
